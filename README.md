> ### Build browser extensions, in the browser.

ex10 is a generative chat interface for building browser extensions directly on the web. It's powered by the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/), built with the [prompt-kit](https://www.prompt-kit.com/) component library (via the shadcn CLI), and leverages [xpra](https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra) with [extension.js](https://extension.js.org/) to provide an in-browser browser sandbox.

The design was inspired by several generative interfaces: [t3.chat](https://t3.chat/), [fragments (e2b)](https://fragments.e2b.dev/), and [chat-sdk](https://chat.vercel.ai/).
