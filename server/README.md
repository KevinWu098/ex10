# Ex10 Session Management

## Current Implementation

The current implementation provides a simple session management system for Xpra servers:

1. When a user requests a new session via `/createSession`, we:
   - Generate a unique session ID
   - Create a restricted Linux user
   - Allocate a unique port for the Xpra server
   - Start an Xpra server for that user on the allocated port

2. When a user accesses their session via `/session/:id`:
   - We validate the session ID

3. When a user accesses `/session/:id/xpra`:
   - We validate the session ID again
   - Redirect to the actual Xpra server at `http://localhost:<port>`

This implementation provides basic session isolation through unique session IDs.

## Future Authentication Plans

The current implementation is a temporary solution. For proper security, we plan to:

1. Add user authentication with JWT tokens
2. Implement proper authorization checks for session access
3. Create a reverse proxy configuration that securely maps authenticated sessions to their corresponding Xpra ports
4. Add session expiration and cleanup logic

## Security Considerations

- The current implementation relies on security through obscurity (random session IDs)
- It does not prevent unauthorized access if someone knows or guesses a valid session ID
- It does not handle session timeout or cleaning up unused sessions

## Usage

1. Create a new session:
   ```
   GET /createSession
   ```

2. Access a session:
   ```
   GET /session/:id
   ```

3. Direct access to Xpra interface:
   ```
   GET /session/:id
   ```
